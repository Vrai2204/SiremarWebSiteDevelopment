# SiremarWebSiteDevelopment

This project was a part of my Web Data Managenment Coursework and was made in a team of 3. My role was of a developer in the team. 
Its a react-based app, where a resident can register and avail benifits like discounts on flight tickets, book events, etc and also connect with 
the admin for any queries. There are two administrative roles, admin and inspector. 
The admin can manage all the inspectors and residents. He can also see statistics about the island.
